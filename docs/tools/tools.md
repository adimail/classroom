# Tools

I am a tools guy. I'm about getting things done quickly and having as little space between my thoughts and actions on the computer.

I like having vim-like bindings and prefer running programs in the terminal for simplicity's sake. You can find my [dotfiles](https://github.com/adimail/dotfiles) on GitHub.

Here is an unordered list of all the tools that make my life easier and that I use on a regular basis:

- nvim
- lazygit
- tmux
- zsh
- fzf
- ffmpeg
- overleaf
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
- google sheets
- google docs
- [cobalt (download multimedia from web)](https://cobalt.tools/)
