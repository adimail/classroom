# BTech Sem-VI

---

List of experiments:

**Group A**

1. Virtual Machine on AWS - Launching the virtual machine on Amazon AWS and doing basic settings.
2. Storage Configuration - Configuring various storages available on AWS and storing, retrieving, deleting the data from those storage applications.
3. Database Configuration - Configuring and using various databases available on Amazon AWS.
4. Networking and Security Services Configuration - Configuring various networking and security options.
5. High availability and scalability services - Configuration of high availability and scalability services (AWS).
6. AWS EC2 Windows Instance - To launch and connect to a Windows instance and to remotely connect to the windows instance.
7. Provision a web server on Linux instance with bootstrapping script - To install an Apache web server on EC2 Linux Instance and to run user data shell script to install Apache web server.
8. AWS EC2 Elastic IP Address - Learn to allocate EIP to your account for dynamic cloud computing and to associate EIP address to Amazon EC2 instance running web server.
9. Mini Project - Implement a project based on all the services studied for a given application on Amazon AWS.

**Group B**

10. Install and configure google app engine.
11. Creating an application in salesforce.com using Apex programming language.
12. Install and configuration of virtualization using KVM.
13. Mini Project: Design and develop custom application using sales force cloud.

We can complete **all experiments** except potentially advanced scalability tasks (Group A - 5) under the free trials or free-tier accounts of AWS. For virtualization (Group B - 12), we'll need a local Linux system.

### Group A (AWS)

1. **Virtual Machine on AWS**:

   - AWS offers 750 hours/month of t2.micro or t3.micro instances (Linux/Windows) under the free tier. We can complete this with the free trial.

2. **Storage Configuration**:

   - Includes 5 GB of Amazon S3 storage and 30 GB of Elastic Block Store (EBS). Feasible with the free trial.

3. **Database Configuration**:

   - Amazon RDS offers 750 hours of db.t2.micro instance and 20 GB of storage. We can complete this task within the free tier.

4. **Networking and Security Services**:

   - Security Groups, VPC configurations, and basic networking services are covered. We can experiment with these for free.

5. **High Availability and Scalability**:

   - Limited resources for Elastic Load Balancer and Auto Scaling. We can test basic configurations but may hit usage limits.

6. **AWS EC2 Windows Instance**:

   - AWS provides 750 hours/month of t2.micro/t3.micro for Windows. Feasible under the free trial.

7. **Provision a Web Server on Linux**:

   - We can use a t2.micro instance to install and run an Apache server. Feasible with the free tier.

8. **AWS EC2 Elastic IP Address**:
   - One Elastic IP is free, but additional IPs incur charges. Feasible with the free tier.

### Group B (AWS, Google Cloud, Salesforce, KVM)

9. **Mini Project on AWS Services**:

   - Feasible if our project stays within free-tier limits of compute, storage, and networking.

10. **Google App Engine**:

    - Google Cloud provides a free tier for App Engine with limited resources. Feasible with the free trial.

11. **Salesforce Application with Apex**:

    - **Free Developer Account**: Salesforce offers a free developer account for Apex and application development. Feasible.

12. **Virtualization using KVM**:

    - **Local Setup**: We don't need a cloud provider. Install KVM on a local Linux system.

13. **Salesforce Custom Application**:
    - **Free Developer Account**: Feasible with Salesforce's free developer account.
