hey, i am Aditya Godse üçâ, an undergrad engineering student who loves computers and codes for fun.

i like to call this place classroom, a less maintained archive of some things that I learn but I keep this repo open for times when I want an organized collection of something to share with other people as a learning resource. i would like to share a part of my classroom with you.

more about me on [adimail.github.io](https://adimail.github.io/)
