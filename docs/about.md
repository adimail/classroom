hey, i am Aditya Godse üçâ, an undergrad engineering student who loves computers and codes for fun.

i like to call this place classroom. this is where i, as a software engineer practiced programming. this is not maintained regularly as intended but I keep this repo open for times when I want an organized collection of something to share with other people as a learning resource. i would like to share a part of my classroom with you.
